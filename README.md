# RimworldUACFurnituresB18Unofficial
Unofficial patch to b18 for Rimworld mod "DOOM - UAC Furnitures" from @Chicken Plucker, @Odstriman and @Viceroy.
It's fast reformat, nano pod is still present so be carefull with it.

How to use: just copy 'DOOM - UAC Furnitures' folder to your mods folder(for example ...\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\) and enable it in game.

Why: I was impatient and wasn't intended to keep it for myself.
